Note that typically a distillation column is required to obtain high purity benzene but that is beyond the scope of this workshop. The non-condensibles separated out in F101 will be partially recycled back to M101 and the rest will be either purged or combusted for power generation.We will assume ideal gas for this flowsheet.
